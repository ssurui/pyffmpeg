Two mailing lists are available :

  * http://groups.google.com/group/pyffmpeg : this list is for regular user questions like compilation troubles.

  * http://groups.google.com/group/pyffmpeg-dev : this list is for development of pyffmpeg itself. It is **not** for development of software that use the pyffmpeg.
